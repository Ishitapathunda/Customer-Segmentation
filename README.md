#  Customer Segmentation – Retail Data Analysis

A comprehensive clustering project that applies **RFM analysis** and **K-Means clustering** on retail customer data to identify distinct buyer personas and enable targeted marketing strategies.

---

##  Features
- Develops customer profiles using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** metrics  
- Identifies distinct customer segments with **K-Means clustering**  
- Enhances interpretability using **PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization**  
- Highlights high-value customers and tailors business strategies accordingly  

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Language & Data Handling:** Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Machine Learning & Clustering:** Scikit-learn (K-Means, PCA)  
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, GitHub, VS Code

##  How to Run Locally

git clone https://github.com/Ishitapathunda/Customer-Segmentation.git
cd Customer-Segmentation

# Create environment and install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch Jupyter Notebook for the full analysis
jupyter notebook notebooks/Customer_Segmentation.ipynb


Once launched, you’ll see EDA, clustering steps, and final visual outputs.

Future Enhancements
